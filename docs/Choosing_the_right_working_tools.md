# Choosing the right working tools and security level
This page will guide you through the initial questions and decisions you should answer and decide before you start buying anything. It is way better than an attempt-error approach that could lead to undesired states and surprises. Go through carefully, you are securing your money.

### 1. What coin(s) are you interested in?

You probably already have selected one or more tokens you want to buy now. If there are more, make a complete list of those you seriously plan to buy now or in near future. Think about how much money you plan to invest and how you split it.

> :bulb: The reason for doing this is that various coins use various wallets, there are also multi cryptocurrency wallets available, but you'll have to check their compatibility and in the end not all coins are supported by HW wallets. So this is important for your future decisions.

### 2. No coins on Exchanges

History of crypto industry showed that Exchanges are not a safe place for your coins. There are couple of incidents and stolen funds from Exchanges every year and despite it all improved very much during last years someone counted that there is a 5% risk of your coins being stolen when stored on Exchange.

We follow the rule "not your keys, not your crypto" which emphasizes the main issue, all the coins are held in their wallets, they have access to it, you don't. If they decide to shut the business and take your coins no one will help you.

If you plan to hold your coins on a Exchange **long-term** then these guides are not for you.

### 3. Software or hardware wallet?

If you are new to crypto, it is absolutely okay to start with 1 coin, small amount of money and a software wallet. Once you get familiar with your crypto handling you can upgrade your security to another level.

On the other hand if know you will use the hardware wallet or your investment will be higher, we recommend you to start with HW wallet from the very beginning and get faimiliar with its use.

> :bulb: Some crypto projects also have a minimum wallet balance set which is not transferrable (and may be unlocked in the future) se the more different wallets you use the more of them you will have with small amount of money. E.g. each EOS wallet has to have a minimum of 1 coin available (3 USD), XRP had 20 coins (6 USD), XLM 1 coin (0,1 USD) and so on.

### 4. Check your hardware wallet

No matter you decided to use software wallet or not, you should know what is available when it comet to hardware (HW) wallets.

There are 2 major HW wallet producers and most crypto projects are trying to integrate with them:

* **Trezor** - check [https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/?offer_id=12&aff_id=5184&source=github_Choosing_the_right_working_tools.md) and scroll down through the page
* **Ledger** -

### 5. Managing wallets from one place

This point is more about managing expectations.

If you plan to buy various coins you probably will have to use different user interfaces when sending and receiving the funds, there is no 1 place capable managing all coins or even all from top 20. But you can minimize that by choosing a multi cryptocurrency wallet or hardware wallet or combination of both.

> :bulb: This has nothing to do with watching your portfolio grow from one place, there are different applications for that

### 6. Multi cryptocurrency wallets

There are many such apps, some of them just mobile, some desktop, some both, just try to Google "multi cryptocurrency wallet". Remember, always use software from known sources so you can be sure your coins are safe.

Therefore we would recommend you **Exodus**, preferably desktop version, visit [www.exodus.io](https://www.exodus.io) and check whether you like it. Exodus has quite wide support and can operate together with HW wallets so in the end you could be using HW wallet as the security key storage and Exodus as the user interface you like and know how to operate.

### 7. Coin compatibility

Now it's time for the list of coins you made in point 1. You will now check their compatibility with HW wallets and Exodus.
