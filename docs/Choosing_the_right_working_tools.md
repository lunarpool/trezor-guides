# Choosing the right working tools and security level
This page will guide you through the initial questions and decisions you should answer and decide before you start buying anything. It is way better than an attempt-error approach that could lead to undesired states and surprises. Go through carefully, you are securing your money.

### 1. What coin(s) are you interested in?

You probably already have selected one or more tokens you want to buy now. If there are more, make a complete list of those you seriously plan to buy now or in near future. Think about how much money you plan to invest and how you split it.

> :bulb: The reason for doing this is that various coins use various wallets, there are also multi cryptocurrency wallets available, but you'll have to check their compatibility and in the end not all coins are supported by HW wallets. So this is important for your future decisions.

### 2. No coins on Exchanges

History of crypto industry showed that Exchanges are not a safe place for your coins. There are couple of incidents and stolen funds from Exchanges every year and despite it all improved very much during last years someone counted that there is a 5% risk of your coins being stolen when stored on Exchange. There were 11 major exchange hacks in 2019 with total amount lost over $117 million.

We follow the rule "not your keys, not your crypto" which emphasizes the main issue, all the coins are held in their wallets, they have access to it, you don't. If they decide to shut the business and take your coins no one will help you.

If you plan to hold your coins on a Exchange **long-term** then these guides are not for you.

### 3. Software or hardware wallet?

If you are new to crypto, it is absolutely okay to start with 1 coin, small amount of money and a software wallet. Once you get familiar with your crypto handling you can upgrade your security to another level.

On the other hand if know you will use the hardware wallet or your investment will be higher, we recommend you to start with HW wallet from the very beginning and get faimiliar with its use.

No matter which way you decide to go, you will need to store your recovery seed somewhere safe, so you should prepare for that as well.

> :bulb: Some crypto projects also have a minimum wallet balance set which is not transferrable (and may be unlocked in the future) se the more different wallets you use the more of them you will have with small amount of money. E.g. each EOS wallet has to have a minimum of 1 coin available (3 USD), XRP had 20 coins (6 USD), XLM 1 coin (0,1 USD) and so on.

### 4. Check your hardware wallet

No matter you decided to use software wallet or not, you should know what is available when it comet to hardware (HW) wallets.

There are 2 major HW wallet producers and most crypto projects are trying to integrate with them:

* **Trezor** by SatoshiLabs - check [https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/?offer_id=12&aff_id=5184&source=github_trezor_guides_Choosing_the_right_working_tools) and scroll down through the page for model comparison
* **Ledger** by Ledger SAS - check [https://www.ledger.com](https://www.ledger.com)

We can not say which one is better, there are different approaches, Trezor's codebase is open-source, Ledger proprietary. Both will provide similar level of security. If you are interested in more details, try to find introductionary videos on Youtube in your language.

> :bulb: This set of guides is done using Trezor so if you decide for Ledger, it's okay, but following these guides will be limited

### 5. Managing wallets from one place

This point is more about managing expectations.

If you plan to buy various coins you probably will have to use different user interfaces when sending and receiving the funds, there is no 1 place capable managing all coins or even all from top 20. But you can minimize that by choosing a multi cryptocurrency wallet or hardware wallet or combination of both.

> :bulb: This has nothing to do with watching your portfolio grow from one place, there are different applications for that

### 6. Multi cryptocurrency wallets

There are many such apps, some of them just mobile, some desktop, some both, just try to Google "multi cryptocurrency wallet". Remember, always use software from known sources so you can be sure your coins are safe.

Therefore we would recommend you **Exodus**, preferably desktop version, visit [www.exodus.io](https://www.exodus.io) and check whether you like it. Exodus has quite wide support and can operate together with Trezor so in the end you could be using Trezor as the security key storage and Exodus as the user interface you like and know how to operate.

### 7. Coin compatibility

Now it's time for the list of coins you made at point 1. You will now check their compatibility and level of support with HW wallets and Exodus.

1. **Trezor compatibility and support**

Visit [https://trezor.io/coins/](https://trezor.io/coins?offer_id=12&aff_id=5184&source=github_trezor_guides_Choosing_the_right_working_tools) and make a note whether your coins are compatible with Model One, Model T and which wallets are supported. If Trezor is listed then you will be able to manage the coin directly from Trezor web page, if there are different wallets listed only then you'll have to visit different website and authorize with your Trezor device. If you see Exodus mentioned as well then our prefered multi wallet is compatible as well.

2. **Ledger compatibility and support**

Visit [https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets/](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets/) and make a note whether Send/Receive is available and which wallets are supported. Similar to Trezor, wherever you see Ledger Live means the coins is manageable natively by the device and its user interface.

3. **Exodus compatibility**

Visit [https://www.exodus.io/status/](https://www.exodus.io/status/) to check the coins Exodus can support. Note that the support is different for Mobile, Desktop and Desktop+Trezor.

### 8. Cryptocurrency portfolio tracker

This is the last missing bit. No matter how you will manage your coins and whther you use HW wallet or not, portfolio tracker is the app you should have for your fast and easy portfolio tracking, price alerting and more (if you like).

Portfolio tracker is an application, preferably mobile, where you keep track of coins you bought, ideally all the buys and their price levels and check your total crypto value. How it is different from a wallet? It does not say whether your crypto are still in your wallet, it shows what balances/trades you put in, but it is handy you have it in your cell phone and can check anytime without the need of complex authorization and feer that someone will hack it and steal your coins.

There are many apps available, we will mention 2 we believe are used by most:
1. **Crypto Pro** - [https://cryptopro.app](https://cryptopro.app), free edition is absolutely fine, this is our choice
2. **Blockfolio** - [https://blockfolio.com](https://blockfolio.com), probably the most popular one

### 9. Help with your decission

Now you should decide which way to go, which wallet to use. To make your decission easier go through these questions. Skip those not relevant:

**Whether to use HW wallet**
1. Is the amount of money I plan to invest high enough to start dealing with higher security?
2. Will I need to be able to send the crypto out anytime, securely?
3. Am I willing to invest into a hardware wallet? (varies between $70 and $215)
4. Does my selected hardware wallet support all (or almost all) the coins I plan to buy? (no matter if directly or via external wallet)

**Software wallet**
1. Is there any multi cryptocurrency wallet that supports all (or almost all) the coins I plan to buy?
2. If I decide to switch to HW wallet which coins are not supported?
3. If I switch to HW wallet I will need to send my coins to new wallets. (it's not a big deal, but there could be minor obstacles like non-movable minimum balance)

### 10. Time for a decission

Test the mentioned applications, play with them, check websites and make the decission.

Don't buy anything yet, we will do that later!
