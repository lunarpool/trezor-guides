## What should you follow and prepare for

### Do not talk about how much cryptocurrency funds you have
In general, it is better to keep quiet about the balances on your accounts. Talking too much is particularly dangerous on social media and internet forums.

For example, if you tell someone on the internet that you own a lot of bitcoins, some malicious party might read that conversation. These people might then try to steal your funds using a variety of tactics - including cyber attacks and physical violence.

Just remember, loose lips sink ships.

### Keep your recovery seed safe
Your recovery seed is all that is needed to access your coins. The physical security of your recovery seed is the most important thing. If you decide to use HW wallet and it is stolen, it is improbable that the thieves would be able to access it without your PIN. However, if someone steals your recovery seed, your coins can be accessed easily using a different device or wallet.

If your HW wallet is lost or stops working, the recovery seed is the only way to get your coins back. It is crucial to store your seed somewhere safe from theft or physical damage (e.g., in case of a fire or a flood). It is generally recommended using a piece of paper or cryptosteel. We will describe this in more detail later, but now it is important that you think about this and find a safe place.

Below are some suggestions about where to keep your recovery seed.

**Where to keep your recovery seed card**
* In a locked drawer, away from water and fire.
* In a place where no potential thieves are likely to access it.
* Somewhere where your family members will find it if something unexpected happens to you.

**Where NOT to keep your seed**
* Shared or public spaces (e.g., your office work desk)
* Dropbox
* Email
* Anywhere online
* Offline (digital) backup (e.g., phone, digital photos, etc.)
* Encrypted folder

## What are the benefits of HW wallets
### Zero trust principle
HW wallet security model works on the zero trust principle. The zero trust principle says that any part of a secure system could be compromised at some point.

However, even if someone hacked your HW wallet, or your computer was infected, HW wallet will keep your funds safe. This unique feature makes HW wallets more secure than any other means of storage.

### Verify and confirm
Let's suppose that you have to make a payment and you only have access to an untrusted computer. How would you verify that the payment will be sent to the right person and not to a malicious third party? An infected computer could easily lie about the transaction amount or destination.

Using the HW wallet screen, you can independently verify and physically confirm every transaction directly on your device.

### A single-purpose computer
HW wallet is a single-purpose computer. There are no additional functions or hardware - nothing that could compromise the device in your hands and the funds in your wallet. Simple means safe.

### Limiting the attack surface
When a computer has to deal with untrusted information, there is a risk of malware or virus infection. HW wallet is no exception. To limit the attack surface, HW wallet communicates through a simple USB protocol. There is no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection, no camera for scanning QR-codes, no fingerprint reader for identifying the user. All these things were taken to make HW wallets as secure as possible. The fewer devices HW wallet communicates with, and the simpler the communication protocol is, the safer.

Also, HW wallet should have no battery. When unplugged, it is off, and your coins are safe from any cyber attacks.
