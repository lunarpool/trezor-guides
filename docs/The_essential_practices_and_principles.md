# The essential practices and principles

## Zero trust principle
HW wallet security model works on the zero trust principle. The zero trust principle says that any part of a secure system could be compromised at some point.

However, even if someone hacked your HW wallet, or your computer was infected, HW wallet will keep your funds safe. This unique feature makes HW wallets more secure than any other means of storage.

## Verify and confirm
Let's suppose that you have to make a payment and you only have access to an untrusted computer. How would you verify that the payment will be sent to the right person and not to a malicious third party? An infected computer could easily lie about the transaction amount or destination.

Using the HW wallet screen, you can independently verify and physically confirm every transaction directly on your device.

## Limiting the attack surface
When a computer has to deal with untrusted information, there is a risk of malware or virus infection. HW wallet is no exception. To limit the attack surface, HW wallet communicates through a simple USB protocol. There is no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection, no camera for scanning QR-codes, no fingerprint reader for identifying the user. All these things were taken to make HW wallets as secure as possible. The fewer devices HW wallet communicates with, and the simpler the communication protocol is, the safer.

Also, HW wallet should have no battery. When unplugged, it is off, and your coins are safe from any cyber attacks.
