# Securing your wallet

We would like to present a set of step-by-step user guides and best practises on how to use Trezor HW wallet, which security basics and best practises to follow.

## Who should use these guides

These guides are primarily focused on mass population managing their "common" wealth & savings. High value crypto accounts or persons having their lifetime savings in crypto or so-called whales should follow much more strict rules and security measurements than provided here.

You now probably ask what is a high value, who is a whale or what is the threshhold to follow higher level of security... The right answer is: it's up to you. You have to take into account the risk of losing your crypto and what it would mean to you.

It is also worth mentioning that **TREZOR Model T** is a device you can buy for around 200 USD, **Trezor ONE** for around 70 USD. Of course you can store your 10 millions USD in crypto to that device and we would recommend you that, but with such a large stake you have to know what to do when you lose your device, how to store its recovery keys, to which device it is safe to connect it and so on.

Okay, you probably still need a treshold, right? We would say 100 000 USD is the boundary. If you have less than that in your crypto, it should be okay to follow these recommendations, if you are over, you should consider another measurements, complementary devices and modus operandi.

To get an idea how these another measurements could look like, watch/study these sources:
